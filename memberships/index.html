		<p>Members can check out most books from the library. You are allowd to have up to eight books checked out at a time. Books are checked out for up to three weeks and may be renewed. You can get a membership by going to the library when it is <a href="% url '/hours/' %}">open</a>. MITSFS requires everyone who wants to checkout books to have a membership. We are not affiliated with the MIT Library's membership system.</p> 

		<p> Dues are tied to the cost of books (our main expense), with a one-year membership costing less than two paperbacks. Dues may be paid with cash or checks (sorry we don't support TechCash currently). Rates are listed below. If you feel like you cannot afford the membership please ask the keyholder on duty for an exemption.</p>

		<p>Membership is not restricted to MIT students, but if you're not in the Boston area you're pretty much just making a donation, which admittedly is fine with us.</p>
