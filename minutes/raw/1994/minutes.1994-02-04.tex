\noindent
MITSFS meeting called to order, 1700 SST,
Jamie Morris, President and Skinner, presiding; [Unknown], Onseck, recording.

An Ode to the Minutes:

A bit of paper fluttering in air,

Artistic creation extraordinaire.

Hours of labor by devoted Onsecks,

A record of a MITSFS meeting past.

A work in sonnet form, no less, no more,

In recompense for minutes lost afore.

Complete and polished minutes cannot be

For the tradition holds since men were born-

Thus lacks this sonnet certain grace and form.

Work and write and toil and trouble

Pen burn and keyboard bubble.
