\noindent
MITSFS meeting called to order, 1700 SST,
Marcus Sarofim, President and Skinner, presiding, residing, and deciding; Anca "Vanna" Mosoiu, Onseck, recording.

As usual, the meeting opened with a discussion of the previous week's minutes. However, it was decided that the previous meeting had fictional minutes, and an endeavor was made to create appropriate happenstances. Jamie Morris, former Skinner and current Bobcat dude was censored by Marcus, powerhungry demagogue who... no, no, Marcus, it's okay, I'm just typing up the real minutes! Put the gavel down! AAAGH...

\goto{New Business}

Ahem... not much of import happened at this meeting. The only new thing to be reported is that MITSFS, through its power and amazing feats of politics, has acquired a BOBCAT server (formerly of the 6.002 lab) and will soon have it installed. Yay! No more OLD PC clone! We can have real machines (well, sort of) in the office.

The usual motion was made and passed.

A motion was made to declare Jamie a banana, which passed.

Meeting adjourned, 1705 SST.
