\noindent
MITSFS meeting called to order, 1700 SST, Herb Miller, President and Skinner, presiding. Donna Bell, Onseck, recording.

No minutes read, and the motion concerning the minutes may or may not have been the same motion that passed before everyone went home for the holidays, but it passed a fair number, to I'm not sure what it was Paul did, to something plus Spehn.

\goto{Committee Reports}
(HAM) Piano Comm - something which induces a lot of clapping and cheers.

At this point, the listening Onseck respectfully tosses the tape in the trash, because she can't make out a single word anyone is saying. Thus, she ends the meeting and runs home to eat a ceremonial banana.
