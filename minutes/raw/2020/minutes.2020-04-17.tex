\noindent
It's the sixth Remote Report! Slightly more to report on this time.

\goto{Committee Reports}

None.

\goto{Old Business}

We are officially hosting a Zoom call for the Midway this Sunday! Hopefully we'll be able to do at least a little recruitment.

\skinner attended the virtual ASA GBM. Doing the elections took the most time, because apparently they have to "follow procedure" and stuff. Luckily that's not a problem at MITSFS.

\goto{New Business}

Uhh...

\goto{Future Business}

Time is a tool you can put on the wall/Or wear it on your wrist/The past is far behind us/The future doesn't exist

\noindent
End report.
