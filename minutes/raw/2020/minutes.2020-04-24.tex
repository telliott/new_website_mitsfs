\noindent
It's the seventh Remote Report! Basically, nothing happened.

\goto{Committee Reports}

None.

\goto{Old Business}

The problem with having a virtual Midway is that we can't catch people's eyes as they walk by; people have to specifically choose to join our call. Nevertheless, we got one person who seemed pretty interested!

\goto{New Business}

Nah.

\goto{Future Business}

"Elections," soonish? Probably when it fits \skinner's schedule, given that it's not really on people's minds at the moment.

The best way to predict the future is to create it. (Abraham Lincoln)

End report.
