MITSFS Remote Report

\noindent
It's the fifth Remote Report! And there's less and less to report on. Nevertheless, the show must go on!

\goto{Committee Reports}

Famecomm: Someone from New York Magazine sent us an email wanting to know about MITSFS members' streaming habits. Nobody responded.

\goto{Old Business}

We registered for Virtual CPW, and also added a couple of representatives to the Discord server they're apparently hosting. We may or may not host a Zoom call for the Midway depending on how many people are available.

\goto{New Business}

\skinner has never been so busy and yet so bored.

\goto{Future Business}

The future is the past. Time is a circle. Or maybe a cube?

\noindent
End report.
