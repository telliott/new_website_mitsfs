\noindent
It's the fourth Remote Report! \skinner is too hosed to deal with Zoom, as it turns out, so we might just have one virtual meeting for elections. Then again, past minutes have promised a lot that didn't happen, so...

\goto{Committee Reports}

None.

\goto{Old Business}

Operation INSOMNIA: wiki's had a bit of cleanup/editing, but the conversion of the locker contents is on hold for a bit.

\goto{New Business}

Virtual CPW is apparently happening! Virtual ASA GBM is also happening. Our involvement in both is TBD.

\goto{Future Business}

Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn. Get it? Because he's... never mind.

\noindent
End report.
