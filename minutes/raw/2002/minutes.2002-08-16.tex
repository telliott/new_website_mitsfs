\noindent
MITSFS meeting called to order, 1700 SST, Ed Keyes, President and
Skinner, presiding.  Everyone in the room had some lame excuse for why
they couldn't possibly be Pseudo-Onseck, and the Skinner's mind-control
powers were at low ebb.

Minutes were read by the Skinner.  Not aloud, though... that's just
what they'd be {\em expecting}...

The rest of the meeting took place in a strange land where there was no
permanent record of its alternately poignant and hilarious happenings.

However, I'm pretty sure that projectile vomiting was involved.

Meeting adjourned, 1749 SST.
