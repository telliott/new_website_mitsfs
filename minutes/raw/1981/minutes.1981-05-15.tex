\noindent
MITSFS meeting called to order, 1700 SST,
Cheryl Wheeler, President and Skinner, presiding.

Motion passes to commend Wendy for reading second minutes.

\goto{Committee Reports}

Moocomm: Flash Gordon tonight ("Go, Flash, go!"). Glob advertised getting into the Sack with Galaxina and Flesh Gordon. Clash of the Titans did.

\goto{New Business}

Some real new business slipped in but was thrown out. (We shouldn't discuss binding books anyway- maybe they don't like being bound.)

We had motions all over the floor so someone suggested picking them up. But they died, poor things. A horrible death.

Oh, I hadn't noticed- the meeting was adjourned, 17:22 SST.

\centerline{Sincerely submitted,}
\centerline{Wendy Rowe, Onseck}
