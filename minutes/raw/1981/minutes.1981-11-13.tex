Cheryl Wheeler, President and Skinner, presiding.

\goto{Committee Reports}

Moocomm: LSC's showing Stir Crazy, starring everyone's favorite 4th Wester and his rat. Also Sherlock and the final Lord of the Rings clue.

\goto{Old Business}

Zip.

Algol- the standard stuff.

\goto{New Business}

Motion to commend Bananacomm fails.

Motion to form Flopcomm to keep track of shuttle failures fails.

Rabbits have no tails at all.
