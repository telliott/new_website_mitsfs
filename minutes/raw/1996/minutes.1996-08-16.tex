\goto{Committee Reports}

Mobcomm: new books. Hardcovers coming within hours, new paperbacks arrived, and more paperbacks ordered.

We have a new member. Everyone stares at Marleigh.

\goto{Future Business}

Motion to ask Marleigh if that's a banana-colored gun in her pocket or if she's just happy to see us. Passes 5-0-0 +Spehn.
