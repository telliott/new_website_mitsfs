Add latex minutes to the appropriate year folder here (if there's no folder here, create one).

Check them into git!

go into the admin folder and run: 

python3 generate_minutes.py <year> 

(you can leave off the year, but it'll reprocess everything, which will take a bit)







Old instructions for posterity:

To initialize a new year's minutes directory
* mkdir /mit/mitsfs/minutes/$NEWYEAR
* mkdir /mit/mitsfs/www/minutes/$NEWYEAR
* cp /mit/mitsfs/minutes/$OLDYEAR/COPYING /mit/mitsfs/minutes/$NEWYEAR/
* cp /mit/mitsfs/minutes/$OLDYEAR/format$OLDYEAR.tex /mit/mitsfs/minutes/$NEWYEAR/format$NEWYEAR.tex
* cp /mit/mitsfs/minutes/$OLDYEAR/.latex2html-init /mit/mitsfs/minutes/$NEWYEAR/

This should really be merged into the Onseck Rites at some point, but I'll leave that for 
others to do.  -KR 6/18/10
