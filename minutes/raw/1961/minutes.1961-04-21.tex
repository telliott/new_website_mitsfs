\noindent
The meeting was brought under partial control by the Most Ineffable President Loren Courtland Skinner II (he of cowboy boot fame) at 1715 Zone+5 Time. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and acclaimed with a burst of spontaneous ecstasy.

\goto{Committee Reports}

As the Treasurix was absent, no report of finances was given.

Libcomm: A pile of ASFs was found in the library- no one knows to whom they belong. There was a flood in the library due to the wrath of some god but no books were damaged. There was also a fire in the bowling alley but this does not concern us in the least.

Theftcomm: no report (absent).

Moocomm: no report.

War Council: McDowell was not seen.

Jourcomm: Another letter from Gernsback was discussed- should we accept money or a machine?

\goto{Old Business}

MSP (Whiton) to accept money or machine. 9-1-3.

\goto{New Business}

MSP (White V) to adjourn at 1747. 7-6.
