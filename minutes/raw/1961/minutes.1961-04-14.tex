\noindent
The meeting was called to order at 1707. Skinner made a fool of himself. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved.

We have 71.87 in the treasury. The 32-dollar check was returned as the WMs had already been sold.

Letters: Gernsback- offered us duplicator. Fassett- loc about TZ.

Harry Stubbs was then introduced and a giant bull session began. Tape recording was made and is in the files.
