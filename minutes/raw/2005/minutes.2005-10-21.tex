\noindent
MITSFS meeting called to order, 1730 SST, Andrew Clough, President and 
Skinner, presiding; John Carr, Pseudo-Onseck, recording.

Bonus pre-meeting quotes:
"How can you fall off a spaceship?"

John: "If you get drunk enough you can fall off of anything?"

Margaret: "I don't want to be surrounded by 5,000 drunken fratboys."

Janet: "There aren't 5,000 people in our class."

Margaret: "I don't want to be surrounded by any drunken fratboys."

Janet is surprised by the several-year-old animals around the library.

While John is busy trying to get last week's minutes online the
Skinner allows a banana motion to pass and the meeting is adjourned.
