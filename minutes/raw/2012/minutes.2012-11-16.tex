Unfortunately, before the meeting could be adjorned, the time anomalies that had been plauging the library all meeting resolved themselves in to a giant time monster that declared it's intention to destroy the earth by making it impossible to ever complete anything in a linear way again. The MIT affiliates laughed at the monster, pointing out that rarely was anything completed in one sitting anymore, and look, hadn't they gotten through the meeting just fine without time happening sequentially. The time monster hung it's head in shame, and appeared to leave.
In that same moment, however, it carried through with its threat, and destroyed the world anyway.
