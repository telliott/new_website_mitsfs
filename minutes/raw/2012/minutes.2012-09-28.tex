\goto{Committee Reports}
Mommycomm: Prentice party Sunday 2-6!

Then the library was distracted from committee reports by the fact that we have a lot of new books, and some of which appears to be crappy Vampire porn.

A wild discussion of self-published books appeared! 

hbarcomm: Maybe we should poster more, and maybe we should look in to other methods of publicizing ourselves
