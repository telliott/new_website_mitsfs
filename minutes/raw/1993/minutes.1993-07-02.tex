\noindent
MITSFS meeting called to order, 1700 SST,
Jamie Morris, President and Skinner, presiding; Marcus Sarofim, Onseck, recording.

Minutes read.

\goto{Committee Reports}

Pianocomm: Arifa Hussein is working for her key.

Libertycomm: the 4th of July is RSN.

At this point, the onseck cleverly brought up the Esplanade, thus ensuring that he and Jamie and Seth would do most of the rest of Inventory themselves. All according to his master plan.

\goto{Old Business}

Paul: Asimov was killed by the FBI.

The algol crept along weakly until Algolcomm (Seth) entered...

Meeting devolved into a discussion of Fermat's Last Theorem. And other mathematical theorems. Anything to avoid real business, I suppose...

Meeting adjourned, 1717 SST.

\centerline{Respectfully submitted,}
