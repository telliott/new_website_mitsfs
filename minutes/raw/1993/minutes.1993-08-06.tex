\noindent
MITSFS meeting called to order, 1700 SST,
Jamie Morris, President and Skinner, presiding; Marcus Sarofim, Onseck fnord, recording.

Large purple hyperintelligent banana shaped creatures bamfed into the MITSFS, eating members left and right. Luckily, the skinner invoked his awesome powers to turn them into small, purple, hyperintelligent newts. The newts are currently in my terrarium. They are working on building a subspace transmitter out of twigs and berries, but are failing miserably.

The crisis over with, the skinner adjourned the meeting in order to go play chill at TEP. The onseck went back to ET to play chill there.
