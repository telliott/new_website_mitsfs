\noindent
The Annual Smoker was held in the Little Theatre at 5:00. Dr. Isaac Asimov introduced Mr. Hugo Gernsback, the Guest of Honor. Mr. Gernsback told anecdotal stories about Nikola Tesla. He then delivered his talk, a copy of which is included in the minutes. Following the talk there was a question and answer period in which Mr. Padlipsky made a fool of himself. In this he was aided by Dr. I. Asimov, Mr. H. Gernsback, and Dr. D. Menzel. Other people asked more interesting questions. After the Smoker about 25 people (including Mr. and Mrs. Gernsback) went to the Window Shop in Harvard Square for dinner. An interesting time was had by all.
