\subsection*{Boriscomm}

We got a new calendar!

\subsection*{Libcomm}

Inventory happened!  Well, mostly.  It still has it standard shambling
undead form for a couple of weeks.  Also, a couple of shelfcodes
slipped through, and we forgot to inventory the comics.  Periodically,
someone checks one out.  Oops.

Motion to commend Libcomm for carefully cataloging the bananas in
MITSFS passes 6-5-1 \ps.

\noindent
Meeting adjourned, 66.6 Ksec SST.
