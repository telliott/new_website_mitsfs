\noindent
The annual picnic of the MITSFS was held at the Blue Hills Reservation from 2 to 5 PM (same hours as physics labs). Dr. Isaac Асимов, his wife, and his kids were present, plus about twenty assorted members. Lewis, who had the food in his car, arrived late. To everyone's surprise, they still had the food. Dr. Asimov presented an autographed copy of his latest book to Campbell for the Society. The coeds taught Asimov some coed songs. An expedition went to the top of the hill to claim the WGBH transmitter in the name of the Society. It was a day well wasted.
