\skinner, presiding; \onseck, recording.

Next week's minutes read.

Banana motion PASSES by overwhelming majority, resulting in a temporal vortex
that throws the entire meeting into L-Space

\goto{Committee Reports}

\subsection*{Star-Chamber}

The meeting seems to be in L-Space.  

\goto{Old Business}

In the past, we fell into L-Space.

\goto{New Business}

Motion to plan an expedition into L-Space in search of more shelf space
that we can incorporate into the library PASSES by temporal necessity.

\goto{Future Business}

In the future it shall be as though the banana motion previously passed had
gone into effect immediately.

Meeting adjourned, 68.4 Ksec SST.
