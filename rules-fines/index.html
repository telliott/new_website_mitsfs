	<h1>Library Rules</h1>
	<ol>
	  <li><strong>Circulating</strong> materials are available for members to check-out.
		<ul>
		  <li> Members may checkout a maxium of eight (8) circulating materials for up to twenty-one (21) days.</li>
		  <li> All books must be checked-out by a Keyholder.</li>
		  <li> Books may only be renewed by bringing them to the library.</li>
		</ul>
	  </li>
	   <li><strong>Reserve</strong> materials are not available for check-out. Most reserve items are in the locked cabinets or a section marked SR.
		<ul>
		  <li> Ask a Keyholder if you're unsure if something is reserve.</li>
		  <li> Reserve materials do not leave the Library without the explicit permission of the Skinner.</li>
		  <li> Reserve materials do not even leave the locked cabinets without a special “sign-out” that allows an item to be read elsewhere in the Library.</li>
		</ul>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Bookdrop</strong>
		<ul>
		  <li>Any batch of books left in the bookdrop or mailed to the library must include a note with the borrower’s name, the list of titles being returned, and the date on which they are returned.</li>
		  <li>Books left without a card and date are considered returned as of the date they are found.</li>
		</ul>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Food and Drinks</strong> are not permitted in the stacks
		<ul>
		  <li>Non-messy foods may be permitted, in the front area, at the discretion of the Keyholder on duty.</li>
		  <li>Never Read or browse Library materials with food in your hands. Your hands should be reasonably clean when handling Library material.</li>
		  <li>Dragons are not permitted to eat the members.</li>
		</ul>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Smoking</strong> is absolutely forbidden. Smokers are subject to expulsion and banishment.</li>
	  <li><strong>Bags</strong> are not allowed in the stacks. Please leave them at the front of the library. </li>
	  <li><strong>Code of Conduct</strong>
		<ul>
		  <li>Keyholders and members are expected to treat each other and library materials with respect. Harassment will not be tolerated.</li>
		  <li>If you have any concerns feel free to talk to a keyholder or email the <a href="mailto:mitsfs@mit.edu">Star Chamber</a> or <a href="skinner@mit.edu">Skinner</a> (current president).</li>
		</ul>
	  </li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Fines</h2>
	<ol>
	  <li>Overdue fines are ten cents ($0.10) per day per item</li>
	  <li>The maximum overdue fine is $4.00 / item .</li>
	  <li>The fine for returning books via the book drop without a note identifying the member and the books being returned is $0.50.</li>
	  <li>Let us know if you lose a book.
		<ul>
		  <li>Overdue fines stop accumulating when a book is reported lost.</li>
		  <li>We prefer lost circulating items be replaced with another copy in the same format, in which case there is no lost book fee.</li>
		</ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Lost fees:
		<ul>
		  <li>Mass-Market Paperbacks: $15.00</li>

		  <li>Bound Magazines: $8.00/issue included + $30 binding fee</li>
		</ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>The fine for accidently removing an item from the library without checking it out is $1.00 per item.</li>
	  <li>Fines for Reserve items are triple those for other materials.</li>
	</ol>
