"M Is for Magic" is Gaiman's most recent short story collection, this
one aimed at younger audiences.  Several of the stories ("October in
the Chair" "How to Talk to Girls at Parties" and "Sunbird") were
previously published in "Fragile Things" and since I had read them
within the past year, I had no interest in reading them again.
They're still good though.

The first story was an awesome start to the book, a juxtaposition
between film noir and nursery tales.  The sheer unlikelyness of the
combination made me laugh.  "Troll Bridge" and "Don't Ask Jack" were
rather creepy.  I very much enjoyed "The Witch's Headstone" about a
rather unique boy who wants to get a present for his new found friend.
It has some potential for expansion.  Either the reader or the author
could go back and fill in details or what-happens-next senarios.

There is also a rather good poem, a story about a great scam, one
featuring a black cat, and one that has a wonderful first sentence:
"Mrs. Whitaker found the Holy Grail; it was under a fur coat."  And
the rest of the story is just as good.
