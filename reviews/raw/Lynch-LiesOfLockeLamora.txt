The Lies of Locke Lamora is Lynch's first book, and it is very good.
I read it in two sittings and it's about 500 pages.  I was quite
excited to find that it is the first of what is planned to be a seven
book series, because if Lynch does as well with the rest of the series
as he did with this one, I have six entertaining books coming up in
the future.

Basically it's a con-artist story.  Locke Lamora and his band of
stalwart companions pull off brilliant hoaxes and empty the pockets of
various wealthy nobility in his city of origin.  The various lies,
stories, and acts are probably the most entertaining part of the book.

I also enjoyed the theology of the book.  The gods don't manifest
themselves, but several characters are quite devout.  The death god's
priests and priestesses have interesting attitudes that would make
most of the normal population look askance at them if their attitudes
were publicly known.  The god of thieves' followers also play a
prominent role.

There's more plot than just the con.  There is someone to fill the
role of clever policeman trying to catch wiley crook.  There's a
murderous-bastard to offset the virtuous thief.  There's a lord of the
underworld of crime who needs to be kept in the dark about Locke
Lamora's real job description.

There's action, clever plots, likable characters, and I really have no
complaints about the book.
